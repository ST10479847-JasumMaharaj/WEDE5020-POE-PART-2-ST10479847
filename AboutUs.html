    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>4 Bakers was founded by a team of four siblings who shared a passion for baking and a dream of creating a bakery that feels like home. What began as a weekend project selling goods in the garage of their home has grown into a full-service bakery with a loyal customer base. With roots in traditional baking and a flair for creative flavours, 4 Bakers continues to grow by focusing on quality, community, and customer satisfaction. We aim to be more than just a bakery, we want to be part of every celebration and everyday moment.</p>
